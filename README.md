## 🤔 What is F5spam?

Are you tired of constantly refreshing a page waiting for the results of an exam? Don't you hate when the information that you need so much is constantly delayed, keeping you on the edge of your seat? Don't worry, because **F5spam** is here for you! **F5spam** is a very simple and basic Python tool that allows you to detect any change in a given URL. There are some additional features, like automatic URL parsing, selection of the reload frequency and getting a notification on your PC/Mac when a change is detected, so that you can run the script and just forget about it.

## 🛠️ Installation
